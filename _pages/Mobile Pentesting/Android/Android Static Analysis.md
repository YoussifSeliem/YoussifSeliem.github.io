# Static Analysis
---
It's about examining the code without executing the program

We are going to see the important files within the android application and how can we benefit from them

# Android Manifest.xml
---
It contains the basic info about the application
- minSDKVersion : which will give us info about the version and then we can detect vulnerability depending on just the version
- package name : It's a unique identifier for the application on the device
As an attacker we address the application through this identifier in our tools and scripts, so it's important information for us

- Permissions
What data & HW components the app needs access to: (camera, BT, internet, etc..)
You can see list of permissions <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission">here</a>
Permissions other than **uses-permission** are more interesting for us. These permissions are defined by the application and if you perform specific task and want to share it with other application then they can request this permission to exchange the data between each other.

- Queries
It may contain application we want to exchange data with and to do that we need to be visible to it
```xml
<queries>
    <package android:name="com.mwr.example.sieve"/>
</queries>
```
In this example we became visible to `sieve` application so we can exchange data with it.
We can use that when we write our attacking app to bypass login screen as example.

- application
We can see many entries like:
    - `allow backup="true"` : This means that the data can be backed up (may be senstive or not)
    - `debuggable="true"` : we are allowed to debug this process of the application
    - `extractNativeLibs="false"` : If we have native libs included they can't be compressed (not important for us), we will need it to be false when we inject frida
    - `neworkSecurityConfig=".."` : Important in dealing with ssl pinning and if it's not included we can define it (we will talk more about it later)

In the appliction we have many components (what the app has in the background)

- Activities
UI element that represents screens in the application (some of them need to be protected)
protection is done using **intent-filters** which says (before you go to this screen you need to go to through this screen based on factors like cookies)
`exported="True"` means that this activity is exposed and can be accessed from outside the app

- Intent-Filter
They are filters listening to specific intents and we will discuss them later

- service
It gots executed in the background as it may be resource intensive and not allowed to be done on UI

- broadcast receiver
It receive info to the application like receiving sms or any data from other application
It's an important attack surface

- Content Providers
serve data from ur app to other apps
most of the time it's related to database
exported content provider can be very dangerous and expose data to any user or app
the xml tag is `provider`

You may find API keys defined
At the top of the manifest you can see `backup` option

We will discuss these parts in more details
## permissions
---
Each app in android system is sandboxed which means that app1 can't access the data of app2
This is implemented by making use of the linux core of android by creating user for each application, so each app can't access the others because it willnot have the privileges by default.
- `/etc/permission/platform.xml` : this file defines the users' IDs which are individual for each app

But what if app wants to access another app or utility like photos, etc....
- this is defined in `/etc/system/packages.xml`

There are users who should be active before the system starts (hardcoded in kernel) like adb shell.
- this is defined in `android_filesystem_config.h`

Now we need to know how can we **ask** for permission ???
we knew that we can see that defined permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml` file
and these permission will be added to `/etc/system/packages.xml`

What about **custom permissions** ??
It makes the apps exchange data between each others
- This permission is defined not used directly
as example
```xml
<permission
    android:label="Allows reading of the key in Sieve"
    android:name="com.mwr.example.sieve.READ_KEYS"
    android:protectionLevel="dangerous"
/>
```
This permission allows reading keys table in sieve application
When we go to content provider we will understand this more
and this defined permission can be used in another app like this
```xml
<uses-permission ns0:name="com.mwr.example.sieve.READ_KEYS"/>
```
<img src="/assets/img/android/capture8.png" alt="permissions">

protection of data is depending on choosing the suitable `protection level`
We have levels:
- `dangerous` : The user is informed about this and the user decides to allow or deny (depending on user decision isn't the best case)
- `normal` : You won't be informed and this isn't considered a protection for senstive data, but it's important for things like internet which doesn't need to be decision before being used
- `signature` : Each apps signed with the same key can access the data (to access database as example which is protected by signtature level then we need the private key of the sieve to access it) This isn't practicle approach as private key can't be shared.

## activity
basically they are the screens of the application.
as example we may have `login activity`, `profile activity`, `settings activity`, `code activity`
There are activities like profile as example who need us to login first before accessing it
We see that the only visible activity or the frontline of our app is login page as example, so what if we want to reach the `code activity` directly by scanning QR code from QR scanner app directly?
The QR scanner must be able to see the `code activity` and this moves us to `exported`: which means that the activity is reachable by outside world (dangerous and handled by intents which will be discussed later)

We can know if the activity is exported or not from `AndroidManifest.xml` file and exported can be implicit and explicit:
- explicit : occures when the activity has the attribute `exported="true"`
- implicit : occurs if the activity has `intent-filter` so it's also reachable from outside world
Exported scheme doesn't only affect activities
<img src="/assets/img/android/capture9.png" alt="activities">

we can make access exported activity using **malicious app** or **adb shell**
after getting adb shell we use the command `am` which is activity manager but we need to identify the activity to be opened
the activity is identified to be `<package name>/<activity name(keep the dot)>` so the command becomes `am start-activity -n <package name>/<activity name(keep the dot)>`

## intents
It's a messaging object and it can be **implict** and **explicit**
- implicit : We don't know the exact destination application like we know it's email app but we don't know which app exactly
- explicit : We know the destination we want to call and the destination can be in the same app or in a different app
It doesn't work with activities only but also **services** and **BroadcastReceivers**
<img src="/assets/img/android/capture10.png" alt="intents">

- Explicit Intents
Consider you have login activity and you want to login to reach profile activity, this can be implemented like this in login activity source code
```java
Intent myIntent = new Intent(this,ProfileActivity.class); // defining the intent by passing the source and the target
this.startActivity(myIntent);
```

If we want to start the new activity with parameters
```java
Intent myIntent = new Intent(this,ProfileActivity.class); // defining the intent by passing the source and the target
myIntent.putExtra("username","admin"); // passing username parameter with value = "admin"
this.startActivity(myIntent);
```

and the parameter is used in the profile activity like this
```java
@Override
Protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState){
    Intent intent = getIntent();
    String user = intent.getStringExtra("username"); // get the passed parameter username
}
```

- Implicit Intents
Here we said that we don't know the destination exactly as example we did an action that send mail and  the exact mail app isn't choosed.
The system sends out this intent and we want to open mail app to do this action (gmail app may be opened as example) but we will know more details in BroadcastReceiver.
If parameters are passed with the intent then there's an attack vectorif the passed data are sensitive as we can create malicious app that listens to this type of intents (mail as example) and it will sniff the system for this information and this is called `Intent - Sniffing`

- Intent-Filter
As example the main activity will have an intent-filter with **action:MAIN** and **category:LAUNCHER**.
It's just listening to bus system and filtering out the info related to the app we need to react with and ignore the others
It has certain tags : `action`, `category` and `data`
we can know more about them and the possible values <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent">here</a>

> Note: if you want to interact with `intent-filter` which is considered implicit use this command `am start-activity -a <action> -c <category> --es <key> <value>`
--es is to pass key value pair data as string

> If there's many apps with the same action, category the user will choose which app to use


## BroadcastReceiver
They are a kind of notification system for ur applications.

There's a specific events like `connecting the headphone`, `connecting to wifi`, etc.... these events are sent as broadcast to all apps
Not all apps react to this, some of them ignore it and the other can react to it through `onReceive` method.

- ordered priority
It was an issue at android 4.3
each app is assigned a specific priority (as example sms has the highest priority = 200)
So it will be the first app to receive the msg and can decide to leave it to the next app with lower priority or not

The problem that in android <= 4.3  The attacker was able to assign it's app a priority up to 999.
This is fixed in android 4.4 and the priority assignment is limited now.

To find which event each app is listening to, There are 2 approaches:
- old approach (until Android version 8): in `AndroidManifest.xml`
- new approach: Finding onReceive function within the Java code

In some broadcast events important data are passed so if we could receive them we may be able to move forward in the target.

Local broadcast manager can't be exploited because we can't interact with it, It's just a messages bewtween classes as example.

> `adb.exe logcat`: to show logging of the app
> to open local console we use `adb.exe local` => this is console at which we can get the output of print function
- Sending broadcast through adb: `am broadcast -a <action in the intent filter or from the source code depending on android version>`
we may not have the permission, so make sure u r root

> `pm -U`: List packages with uid so we can broadcast to specific uid and replcace `a` with 10, so the broadcast command can be `am broadcast --user <uid> -a <action>`

If there's string info to be sent with the Intent filter we can use `--es` option as we know.




## Services
Consider you have a game and it needs some processes like rendering the game and organization of objects (in UI) and we also need network requesting as example.
If all these components are in the main activity we will have a problem: The network request may stop the UI thread until the request is done which may result in closing the app (the app in android is closed if the UI thread isn't working for some seconds).
The solution is to make the components which isn't in the UI to be services in background

We have 2 types of services: `start service` & `bound service` 
- `start` : very simple just the service started when we need it to do some task then close it.
- `bound` : binding client to service (we may have client interacting with the app) then we need to wait for the clients to disconnect to shutdown this service
<img src="/assets/img/android/capture11.png" alt="serviceTypes">

> The services can't make UI updates as they work in the background
If we want to do so we may make use of BroadcastReceiver and make them trigger the service via `onReceive()`
This was the common behvior till android 8 cause this background execution isn't allowed any more.

What to look for ?
- `start` : here you will look into intent
- `bound` : look into the message object
to attack the service it needs to be Exported and Permissions to interact with this one.

## ContentProvider
It's simply provide a content and usually it's used with databases, we can interact with them via content URI.
as example The Contacts they are stored in db and there's content provider for this data base.
content URI is used to interact with them and in consists of:
- `prefix` : which is **content://** and it's a good keyword to search for when reversing the app
- `authorty` : It's a unique identifier for the content provider
- `table entry`
- `row in table`

Content provider are excluded from intents so interaction with them is done in different way like using `adb shell` and then the command will be `$ content query --uri content://com.android.contacts/contacts/1`

What if we don't have adb shell access, so we will write our malicious app.
in our app we want to define `ContentResolver` that asks the content provider to provide the content to us
we need 2 use cases:
- Having permissions
- Exported: True

Then after asking, thew content provider returns a `Cursor`(pointer to data in db) to our app
The content provider must include `query`, `update`, `insert` and `delete` methods and we will use them in the resolver for interaction with the provider

The data base of custom content provider are stored in `data/data/<package>/db`


<img src="/assets/img/android/capture13.png" alt="query">
Here we see the structure of `query` function and how it's mapped to sql query.

<img src="/assets/img/android/capture14.png" alt="sqli">
and here we see a basic application of sqli.

content providers aren't invoked by intents so to interact with it, it must be exported.

ContentProvider can also read and write files this moves us to `path traversal` vulenerability.
Let's look in accessing file using content provider
<img src="/assets/img/android/capture15.png" alt="path traversal">
we see that the file is vulenrable to path traversal so the app can get pin.xml file in this example

The content provider is exported if we have read or write permissions, but the protection level may prevent us from exploitation if it's signature.
protection level dangerous can be ok if the data is encrypted.

from the source code we can reach the implementation information of db like the database.db file and the tables' names.
> note: if table name is db structure source code = `key` and it's refrenced in the manifest as `keys` we will use `key` in sqli.

interaction with content provider using adb shell is done using `content query|insert|... --uri <content provider uri>`
OFC the table must be accessable (we should have Read or write permissions), but we have another accessable table we can make use of it to reach the protected table.

Example: passwords table is accessable but key isn't and we have this command `content query --uri content://.....DBContentProvider/passwords` we can make use of projection for sqli like this `content query --uri content://.....DBContentProvider/passwords --projection "* from key--"` so the query became `select * from key -- from passwords ...` but all after the -- is commented so we can ignore it now and celebrate with the key data we got.

If the protected uri isn't defined in regex we can query it directly like this `content query --uri content://.....DBContentProvider/keys/`

Insertion in DB: we can see its syntax from the help of adb shell content.


# signing
It's needed in many things like keeping track if there's an update for the app in the store
package name isn't enough because it's unique on the phone only but we can create apps with the same package name of other apps in the store.

So the developer signs the application with a private key and the signature with the package name are used to know that the app on our phone is the one on the store and this update is for it.

Private keys used for signing applications must be super safe.

This process is for verifing the author of the app.

> we can sign 2 different apps with the same signature so they can share data together without the need of exported components so the components are no longer exposed to the whole world, but the app we need to exchange the data with only.


If we want to modify app.
- use apktool to decompile the apk using `apktool d game.apk`
- you will get the decompiled files and you can modify what you want
- build the apk again `apktool b game.apk`
- We can't install the apk if it isn't signed so we sign it using `zipalign` for preparing offset for the certificate to be placed in the correct place and `apksigner` for signing the app
- before android 11 we could use `jarsigner` directly for signing

Let's see the process in more details
- generation the key
`keytool -genkey -v -keystore <path/to/keystore file> -alias alias_name -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 365`
    - `-getkey` for generating the private key
    - `-v` make the certificate human readable
    - `keystore` is a file which is the place at which the key will be stored
    - `alias` it's the way we will define the key
> note that many keys can be saved in the same keystore but of course the alias will be different

- for signing
`zipalign -v 4 base.apk out.apk`
`apksigner sign --ks-key-alias <alias name> -ks <path/to/keystore file> out.apk`
alias is needed if there are more than a key in the keystore

> METAINF dir contains all signing information so it must exist after signing

# Common Application Strings
---
We may find useful strings to get more info

- Hardcoded Strings
can be found in: `resources/strings.xml`, `activity source code`
we may find: `login creds`, `api key`, `exposed url`, `firebase URLs`
